My Masters Thesis

This repo conatians the resources for my master thesis.

If you are intrested in the code I developed for my experiments: Go to src direcotry.

Notes about the code:
Its all mumbo jumbo now, I am ashamed of it!
The only excuse I have is that, this code was for exploring my research question.


But If you are thinking of marking me down for it! Please consult me once I can "try" to explain the code.


P.S. This code is intended to run on a Spark Cluster, contact me if you need help running locally.
